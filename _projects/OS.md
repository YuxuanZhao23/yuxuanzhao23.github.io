The Option Summary View is a position page available to customers whose accounts are approved to trade options.

This view gives customers the ability to sort their option positions by Expiration, Strategy or Underlying.

In addition, the view displays margin requirements and current values for the related positions.

We have revamped this classic Option Summary Page. The new Option Summary features a responsive layout, real-time streaming quotes, and an elegant design.

- I enhanced the option summary grid using AG-Grid, boosting user productivity by 25%
- I led the design and implementation of GraphQL schema and resolvers
- I created Schematic rules to automatically generate or modify code templates and layouts
