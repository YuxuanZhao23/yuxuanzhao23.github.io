Hi there! I’m Yuxuan Zhao, a passionate and innovative Senior Software Engineer at Fidelity, always eager to tackle new challenges with creativity and precision. Along my journey, I’ve had the amazing opportunity to intern at <a href='https://www.cgi.com/en/overview'>CGI</a>, <a href='https://www.webex.com'>Cisco Webex</a>, <a href='https://www.sensetime.com/en/about-index#0'>SenseTime (Shanghai AI Lab)</a>, and <a href='https://research.lenovo.com/webapp/view_English/home.html'>Lenovo Research (AI Lab)</a>, each adding a unique spark to my experience.

I’m also a dedicated researcher, with over 8 years of experience and 3 papers published in top conferences and journals. I earned my Master’s in Computer Science from <a href='https://www.brown.edu'>Brown</a>, and I also studied Computer Science at <a href='https://www.harvard.edu/'>Harvard</a> and <a href='https://www.liverpool.ac.uk'>University of Liverpool</a>!

With a strong track record in the tech world and a love for problem-solving, I’m always looking for innovative ways to exceed user expectations. Let’s build something incredible together!
