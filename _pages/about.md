Hi there! I'm Yuxuan Zhao, an innovative, detail-oriented, and passionate Full Stack Engineer 3 at Fidelity. With over 2 years of experience, I've been happily architecting and developing robust and scalable applications using Angular, React, and Node.js. I've also had the pleasure of interning at CGI, Cisco, SenseTime, and Lenovo Research.

I’m also a dedicated researcher with over 3 years of experience in Human-Computer Interaction, having published 3 papers in top conferences and journals. I'm a proud <a href='https://www.brown.edu'>🐻 Bear</a>, having earned my Master of Science in Computer Science from Brown University. And yes, I even survived the notoriously challenging Data Structures and Algorithms course at <a href='https://www.harvard.edu/'>Harvard</a>!

With a proven track record in the tech industry and a strong educational background, I thrive on creating innovative solutions that exceed user expectations. Let's build our amazing future together!
